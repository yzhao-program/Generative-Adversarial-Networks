# Generative-Adversarial-Networks

There are many different types of generative adversarial networks (GANs). Here are the two types of them:
1. Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN)
2. Conditional Self-Attention Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network

Implemented two Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network and Conditional Self-Attention Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with CIFAR-10 dataset with Pytorch.
